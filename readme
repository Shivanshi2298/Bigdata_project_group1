Objective: Analysing the Decadal Urban Growth for Pune using machine learning technique, here Random Forest Machine Learning tool is used.
Google Earth Engine is used to import, analyse and see the results in a dashboard: the code for this is attatched with it.
Description of the code:
The initial steps of the code are the functions which is used to obtain better images from the satellite for efficient.Functions for removal of cloud, calculating ndvi 
and ndbi, later adding them to image that is needed to be classified area done.
Secondly, the steps for adding the respective field points (water, barren land,vegetation and urban) for respctive classes and they were divided into trating and
validation samples randomly in the propportion og 7:3 for classification.
Thirdly, the classification is done using Random Forest algorithm using the training samples and validated using validation sampled wiwth thr hep of accuracies 
and kappa coefficients.
Later, a dashboard was created to to display the landuse and land cover of the respctive years,areas of each classes, the growth in area and rate of growth in percentage
between the specified years using the panels and widgets in google earth engine and published as an app later.
